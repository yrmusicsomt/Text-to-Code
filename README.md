# Starcoder7B QLoRA Fine-tuning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning the **Starcoder7B** model using **QLoRA**. The process involves efficient parameter fine-tuning and model saving.

## Overview

This notebook is designed for fine-tuning the **Starcoder7B** model using **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**, which allows large models to be fine-tuned efficiently with reduced memory consumption. The trained model is then saved and pushed to a repository.

## Features

- Fine-tuning **Starcoder7B** with **QLoRA**.
- Leveraging **transformers**, **bitsandbytes**, and **Hugging Face Accelerate** for optimization.
- Efficient checkpoint saving and pushing to the model hub.

## Setup & Installation

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install transformers accelerate peft bitsandbytes datasets huggingface_hub torch
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 5_Starcoder7b_Final_finetune_new_qlora_finetune_save_push.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load the Starcoder7B model.
   - Apply **QLoRA** adaptation for fine-tuning.
   - Train the model on your dataset.
   - Save and push the fine-tuned model.

## Model & Training Details

- **Model**: Starcoder7B
- **Fine-tuning method**: QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Frameworks used**: ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT, Bitsandbytes
- **Hardware requirements**: GPU with CUDA support (for efficient training)
